# CSC300-VMS
A Vending Machine System (VMS) for an assignment at National University.

This is an implementation of the following problem description:

Products can be purchased by inserting the correct number of coins into the machine. A user selects a product from a list of available products, adds coins, and either gets the product or gets the coins returned if insufficient money was supplied or if the product is sold out. Products can be restocked, and money removed by an operator.
